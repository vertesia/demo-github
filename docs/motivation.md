# GitHub Agent

The GitHub Agent is built to assist with the pull-request process.

* **It facilitates the navigation to the cloud resources.** When a pull request is created, a new development environment is created. This agent makes a comment to indicate the deployment specification and how to navigate to different resources. Instead of reading the document, it provides highly relevant information so that the author and reviewers of the pull request can focus on the actual review and validation rather than looking for information in different places. Different from Vercel, this comment is closer to our business logic and has full coverage of all kinds of resources. See example https://github.com/vertesia/studio/pull/1214#issuecomment-2664941283
